A deep model consisting of 2 convolutional layers with max-pooling and 2 fully connected layers is trained on a low level representation of audio data (segmented spectrograms) with deltas.

Practical {PostgreSQL} fills that void with a fast-paced guide to installation, configuration, and usage. This comprehensive new volume shows you how to compile {PostgreSQL} from source, create a database, and configure {PostgreSQL} to accept client-server connections. It also covers the many advanced features, such as transactions, versioning, replication, and referential integrity that enable developers and {DBAs} to use {PostgreSQL} for serious business applications. The thorough introduction to {PostgreSQL}'s {PL}/{pgSQL} programming language explains how you can use this very useful but under-documented feature to develop stored procedures and triggers. The book includes a complete command reference, and database administrators will appreciate the chapters on user management, database maintenance, and backup \& recovery. With Practical {PostgreSQL}, you will discover quickly why this open source database is such a great open source alternative to proprietary products from Oracle, {IBM}, and Microsoft.},

            Support vector machines ({SVMs}) are a family of machine learning methods, originally introduced for the problem of classification and later generalized to various other situations. They are based on principles of statistical learning theory and convex optimization, and are currently used in various domains of application, including bioinformatics, text categorization, and computer vision.

We demonstrate our open source plant imaging and processing solution (‘{PhenoBox}’/‘{PhenoPipe}’) and provide construction plans, source code and documentation to rebuild the system. Use of the {PhenoBox} is exemplified by studying infection of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon by the head smut fungus Ustilago bromivora, comparing phenotypic responses of maize to infection with a solopathogenic Ustilago maydis (corn smut) strain and effector deletion strains, and studying salt stress response in Nicotiana benthamiana. In U. bromivora-infected grass, phenotypic differences between infected and uninfected plants were detectable weeks before qualitative head smut symptoms. Based on this, we could predict the infection outcome for individual plants with high accuracy. Using a {PhenoPipe} module for calculation of multi-dimensional distances from phenotyping data, we observe a time after infection-dependent impact of U. maydis effector deletion strains on phenotypic response in maize. The {PhenoBox}/{PhenoPipe} system is able to detect established salt stress responses in N. benthamiana. We have developed an affordable, automated, open source imaging and data processing solution that can be adapted to various phenotyping applications in plant biology and beyond.},

This paper presents a new purpose of working with {MFCC} by using it for Hand gesture recognition. The objective of using {MFCC} for hand gesture recognition is to explore the utility of the {MFCC} for image processing. Till now it has been used in speech recognition, for speaker identification. The present system is based on converting the hand gesture into one dimensional (1-D) signal and then extracting first 13 {MFCCs} from the converted 1-D signal. Classification is performed by using Support Vector Machine. Experimental results represents that proposed application of using {MFCC} for gesture recognition have very good accuracy and hence can be used for recognition of sign language or for other household application with the combination for other techniques such as Gabor filter, {DWT} to increase the accuracy rate and to make it more efficient.},

Sound waves are transduced into electrical impulses that the brain can interpret as individual sound frequencies. The spiral configuration of the cochlea allows for differing frequencies to stimulate specific areas along the spiral, which results in a tonotopic map that enables humans to perceive various frequencies of sound. Specific areas along the cochlea are stimulated by vibrations carried within a fluid known as endolymph in the cochlear duct. The vibrations are then converted to electrical impulses in the cochlear duct through mechanical stimulation of hair cells within a unique structure known as the organ of Corti. The vestibulocochlear nerve ({CN} {VIII}) then carries these impulses from the cochlea to the brain's auditory cortex for interpretation.},

	abstract = {In sound processing, the mel-frequency cepstrum ({MFC}) is a representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound, based on a  linear cosine transform of a log power spectrum on a nonlinear mel scale of frequency.
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients ({MFCCs}) are coefficients that collectively make up an {MFC}. They are derived from a type of cepstral representation of the audio clip (a nonlinear "spectrum-of-a-spectrum"). The difference between the cepstrum and the mel-frequency cepstrum is that in the {MFC}, the frequency bands are equally spaced on the mel scale, which approximates the human auditory system's response more closely than the linearly-spaced frequency bands used in the normal spectrum. This frequency warping can allow for better representation of sound, for example, in audio compression that might potentially reduce the transmission bandwidth and the storage requirements of audio signals.
{MFCCs} are commonly derived as follows:
Take the Fourier transform of (a windowed excerpt of) a signal.
Map the powers of the spectrum obtained above onto the mel scale, using triangular overlapping windows or alternatively, cosine overlapping windows.
Take the logs of the powers at each of the mel frequencies.
Take the discrete cosine transform of the list of mel log powers, as if it were a signal.
The {MFCCs} are the amplitudes of the resulting spectrum.There can be variations on this process, for example: differences in the shape or spacing of the windows used to map the scale, or addition of dynamics features such as "delta" and "delta-delta" (first- and second-order frame-to-frame difference) coefficients.The European Telecommunications Standards Institute in the early 2000s defined a standardised {MFCC} algorithm to be used in mobile phones.},
